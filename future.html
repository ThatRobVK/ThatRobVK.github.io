            <h2>Oh <em>that</em> Rob VK!</h2>
            Let's see, what do I put in my dating profile... I started coding when I was 9 years old and started my first coding job back in 2000. I dropped out of uni because I thought it was boring.<br/>
            I've done most of the tech jobs: developer, senior dev, tech lead, architect. On the non-tech side I've been a project manager, operations manager, engineering manager. I love creative problem solving, building visions of the future and collaborating to get there. It doesn't matter whether it's software, an org structure, processes, etc.<br/>
            Oh and I'm loud, excitable, driven and wear shirts some (ok: most) would call awful. But other than that I'm generally pretty nice.<br/>
            Currently I'm a public speaker for <a href="https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/">The Children's Society</a>, I also speak on technical topics at various events, I'm studying business & management at The Open University and I'm a principal consultant at an amazing company called <a href="https://www.infinityworks.com">Infinity Works</a> which includes consulting, commercial account leadership and being an advocate to support people's career growth.<br/>
            <h2>So where to next?</h2>

                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertvankootenuk/"><img src="images/linkedin.png" height="50" width="200" alt="LinkedIn logo" /> My LinkedIn profile</a> is the boring stuff like my CV. I mostly just share my company's posts. Message here for work related stuff, but don't expect a swift response.

                Carefully curated messages that show me in the best light, cleverly disguised as random ramblings. DM me to get my attention.
