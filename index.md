I started coding when I was 9 years old and started my first dev job back in 2000. I tried uni but dropped out because I didn't learn anything new and got bored.

I've done most of the tech jobs: dev, senior, tech lead, architect, data, infra (cloud and physical). I've also done project-, ops- and engineering management, scrum master, product owner. I love creative problem solving, no matter if it's software, org structure, processes, etc.

Oh and I'm loud, excitable, driven and wear shirts that some (ok: most) would call awful. But other than that I'm generally pretty nice.

I speak for [The Children's Society](https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/) and at tech events, study business & management at the Open University and I'm a Principal Consultant for an amazing company called [Infinity Works](https://www.infinityworks.com), a job that allows me to do lots of fun and challenging tech and business stuff.
