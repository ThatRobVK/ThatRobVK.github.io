<p>I started coding when I was 9 years old and started my first dev job back in 2000. I tried uni but dropped out because I didn’t learn anything new and got bored.</p>
<p>I’ve done most of the tech jobs: dev, senior, tech lead, architect, data, infra (cloud and physical). I’ve also done project-, ops- and engineering management, scrum master, product owner. I love creative problem solving, no matter if it’s software, org structure, processes, etc.</p>
<p>Oh and I’m loud, enthusiastic, driven, and wear shirts that some (<em>ok: most</em>) would call awful. But other than that I’m generally pretty nice.</p>
<p>I speak for <a href="https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/">The Children’s Society</a> and at tech events, study business &amp; management at the Open University and I’m a Principal Consultant for an amazing company called <a href="https://www.infinityworks.com">Infinity Works</a>, a job that allows me to do lots of fun and challenging tech and business stuff.</p>
